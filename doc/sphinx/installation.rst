Installation
============

SDK
---

For each platform there is a SDK which contains

  * Static library
  * Shared library
  * Headers

To install the static or shared library you have to copy them in the right folder. For instance, on Linux it would be in ``/usr/lib`` and ``/usr/include``.


Python
------

To install the Python API (example with ``Python 3.5``):

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install lief-XX.YY.ZZ_py35.tar.gz
